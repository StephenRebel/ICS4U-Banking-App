Planning
Project will be divided relatively evenly. Coding will be done in NetBeans and saved through GitHub, where our workload can be tracked.

The app will start with a menu where the user can choose which account they want to login to, or create a new account. Once logged in, the user will be able to see their balance in both their savings and checking accounts. From each account, the user will be able to do their proper actions, such as withdrawing and depositing money. The user will also be able to transfer money from one account to another.
